        <p> 
            Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients because they perform hundreds of roles in the body.<br>
            There is a fine line between getting enough of these nutrients (which is healthy) and getting<br>
            too much (which can end up harming you). Eating a healthy diet remains the best way to get
            sufficient amounts of the vitamins and minerals you need.

<h3>PROTEINS</h3>
</div>
<div id="proteins">
<p>
    Protein makes up the building blocks of organs, muscles, skin, hormones
    and pretty much everything that matters in your body.
    For this reason, you should eat high-quality protein at every meal.
    Studies show that this improves health in various ways, such as helping you lose weight and belly fat,
    while increasing your muscle mass and strength.
    A diet high in protein also lowers blood pressure, fights diabetes and more.

<h3>CARBOHYDRATES</h3>
</div>
<div id="carbon">
<p>
The main function of carbohydrates is to provide fuel for the nervous system and keep muscles on the move.
Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly
coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go
live. This iterative process allows for changes as business
requirements evolve.</p>
