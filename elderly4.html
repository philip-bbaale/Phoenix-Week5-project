    <h1>You're Probably Eating Some of the Most Unhealthy Foods in the World.</h1>
    <pre>
        Even though most of us get a baseline education in nutrition — or at least an outdated version of the
        food pyramid — in school, it’s easy to go through life without a clear understanding of what is and isn’t
        healthy. It doesn’t help that the clever marketing of food corporations looking to make more money advertises
        healthier options, but those foods are full of artificial ingredients, dangerous artificial sugars, and processed
        ingredients your body doesn’t know how to digest. The following are 15 of the unhealthiest foods on the planet,
        including an item that’s often recommended for its alleged health benefits.
    </pre>
        <h2>1. Coffee creamer.</h2> 
        <img src="./images/elderly/Coffee_creamer.jpg"><br><br>
        <h4>Troubling ingredient: Canola oil?</h4><br><br>
        <pre>
            A lot of people need coffee first thing in the morning. But have you ever peeked at the ingredients
            on your fancy coffee creamer before pouring it in your coffee? You might be surprised to find the first
            three ingredients are often water, sugar, and then canola oil. Why is canola oil bad for you? Well, it has
            very little nutritional value, and it does have unhealthy fats.
        </pre>
        <h4 style="color:red;">Instead try: Half and half, regular cow’s milk, or a plant-based creamer</h4><br><br>
        <h2>4. Diet soda</h2>
        <img src="./images/elderly/glass_of_dark_cola.jpg"><br><br>
        <h4>Troubling ingredient: Aspartame!</h4><br><br>
        <pre>
            It’s so tempting to reach for the diet soda instead of regular pop if you’re trying to cut calories
            and lose weight. But with diet soda, it is vital to consider the cost. Your zero calorie drink is full
            of other harmful ingredients. Aspartame is a known carcinogen. And aspartame has the opposite effect on
            your weight loss goals since it causes your blood sugar to spike, triggering your body to store fat.
        </pre>
        <h4 style="color:red;">Instead try: Sparkling water, coffee, infused water, or even a treat like dark chocolate</h4><br><br>
        <h2>5. Cured bacon and sausage</h2>
        <img src="./images/elderly/cooked_bacon.jpg"><br><br>
        <h4>Troubling ingredient: Nitrites and nitrates!</h4><br><br>
        <pre>
            Everyone loves bacon. If you don’t, we don’t want to be your friend. Jokes aside, bacon and sausage can be
            bad for you due to the way they are processed. The processing creates inflammatory compounds, and nitrates
            and nitrites cooked at high heat can be carcinogenic.
        </pre>
<h4 style="color:red;">Instead try: Cook your breakfast meats at lower temperatures and look for uncured varieties!</h4><br><br>
     <h2>6. Sugary cereals.</h2>
     <img src="./images/elderly/fruit_loops.jpg"><br><br>
     <h4>Troubling ingredient: Added sugars, refined carbs, and BHT/BHA!</h4><br><br>
     <pre>
         Let’s start with the sugar content. You might think cereal is better for you than a donut, but you’d be wrong
         if you like to fill your bowl with Fruity Pebbles or Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Plus, some cereals have additives
         (butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole) that are banned in most other countries as they are
         considered carcinogenic. There’s no need to put that in your bodies, friends.
    </pre>
    <h4 style="color:red;">Instead try: Oatmeal with fresh berries and honey or maple syrup for sweetness!</h4><br><br>
    <h2>7. Canned frosting.</h2>
    <img src="./images/elderly/frosted.jpg"><br><br>
    <h4>Troubling ingredient: Artificial coloring, soybean oil, propylene glycol!</h4><br><br>
    <pre>
        As with many foods from the center aisles of the grocery store, there are a lot of unhealthy added ingredients in frosting.
        Propylene glycol found in many frostings is connected to kidney failure. And artificial colors (even in your white frosting)
        are linked to things as mild as hyperactivity to as severe as cancer.
    </pre>
        <h4 style="color:red;">Instead try: Making your own frosting is super easy and even more delicious!</h4><br><br>
