                    <h3>Calcium.</h3>
                    <p>The recommended dietary allowance for calcium during pregnancy is 1,000 mg. Anyone who is less than 18 years old, who is pregnant, should aim to consume 1,300 mg of calcium daily.

                        Calcium helps the baby’s bones and teeth form, and it plays a role in the smooth running of the muscles, nerves, and circulatory system.</p>

                    <h3>Folate.</h3>
                    <p>Folate is a B vitamin. The synthetic form of folate is called folic acid.

                        Folate is essential during pregnancy as it helps prevent neural tube defects, including spina bifida, and reduces the risk of premature labor.
                        
                        An analysis of 18 studies also suggests that folic acid significantly decreases the risk of congenital heart defects. However, more research is still needed.
                        
                        During and before pregnancy, women should consume 400 to 800 micrograms (mcg) of folate or folic acid daily</p>

                    <h3>Iron.</h3>
                    <p>Iron helps to carry oxygen around the body. During pregnancy, iron supplies oxygen to the developing baby.

                        If a diet is lacking in iron, it could cause anemia, which increases the risk of complications, such as premature birth and postpartum depression.
                        
                        The recommended daily iron intake during pregnancy is 27 milligrams (mg).</p>

                    <h3>Protein.</h3>
                    <p>In the later stages of pregnancy, women should aim to eat 1.52 grams (g) per kilogram (kg) of body weight each day to help the baby’s brain and other tissue grow. For example, a woman who weighs 79 kg (175 pounds) should try to eat 121 g of protein daily.

                        Protein is also necessary for the growth of the mother’s uterus and breasts.</p>

                    <h3>Fluids.</h3>
                    <p>Pregnant people need more water than those who are not pregnant to stay hydrated. Water helps form the placenta and the amniotic sac. Dehydration during pregnancy can contribute to complications, such as neural tube defects and reduced breast milk production.

                        Anyone who is pregnant should drink at least 8 to 12 glasses of water a day to prevent dehydration and its complications.</p>
